Data 140: Probability for Data Science — Spring 2025

Welcome to my repository for Data 140: Probability for Data Science, a course I completed in Spring 2025 at UC Berkeley. 
This repo contains my homework and lab assignments from the course.

About the Course

Data 140 is an upper-division data science course that covers core concepts in probability theory with applications to data science. Topics include:
- Random variables and their distributions
- Expectations, variances, and covariances
- Central Limit Theorem and Law of Large Numbers
- Moment generating functions
- Convergence concepts
- Random sampling and estimation techniques
- Applications of probability in data analysis
- The course uses Python (via Jupyter Notebooks) for computation and visualization.
